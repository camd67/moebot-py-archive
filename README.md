# MoeBot
A (new) new version of MoeBot

Post all sorts of moe, memes, and also some actually useful moderation features!

## List of Commands
All commands are prefaced with `moe`
* `random` - returns a random image from r/awwnime/hot
* `count` - counts up that user's messages in that channel
* `danb tag` - searches and returns a random image given a tag (no autocomplete or corrections!)
* `sleep` - sleeps for about 5 seconds
* `brainpower` - spams twitch chat
* `goodshit` - classic meme time
